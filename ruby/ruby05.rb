# 11. Grading Students
    # If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of  is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5
    # If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade
    # grading_students has the following parameter(s):
        # grades: an array of integers representing grades before rounding
    # return an integer array consisting of rounded grades.

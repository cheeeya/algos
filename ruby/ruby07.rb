# 31. Utopian Tree
    # The Utopian Tree sapling has a height of 1. 
    # It goes through 2 cycles of growth every year.
    # Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter
    # If planted in the spring, return the integer height of the tree after the input number of growth cycles.
    # utopian_tree has the following parameter(s):
        # n: an integer, the number of growth cycles to simulate

    # dynamic programming
